# Test data generation scripts   

Contains a few scripts for producing dummy-data that is used in integration and UAT testing.
Better versions of these scripts exist but I'm hesitant on making them public due to NDA.

I would describe these as "Quick and Dirty".

The scripts were not designed or engineered with sustainability in mind and as such are not reflective of my capabilities.   

## Scripts:
##### IBAN.py - Fake IBAN bank accounts that pass validation algorithms.
##### hetu.py - Fake social security number (->hetu) generator, these also pass validation.
##### employeeC.py - Generates objects, that can be called, from pseudo-randomly picked data. f.e: Name, email, home-address, phonenumber, etc.
